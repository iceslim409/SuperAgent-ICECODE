    Gates:

      - last_run_at present AND older than interval_hours

    First-run behavior: when there is no ``last_run_at`` (fresh install, or
    install that predates the curator), we DO NOT run immediately. The
    curator is designed to run after at least ``interval_hours`` (7 days by
    default) of skill activity, not on the first background tick after
    ``hermes update``. On first observation we seed ``last_run_at`` to "now"
    and defer the first real pass by one full interval. Users who want to
    run it sooner can always invoke ``hermes curator run`` (with or without
    ``--dry-run``) explicitly — that path bypasses this gate.

    The idle check (min_idle_hours) is applied at the call site where we know
    whether an agent is actively running — here we only enforce the static
    gates.
